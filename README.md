# DP-900-Azure-Data-Fundamentals

> ### **___Personal Objective/Project Background___**

> I wanted to learn both Git/GitHub and anything data with Azure. I first started the DP-900 and while trying to prepare for the exam, I was thinking how best to organise my notes to share with my close colleagues. As I was looking into options, I realised what better way to kill two birds with one stone and create a project on GitHub. 

> The questions are a combination from the Udemy course and what I thought would be good for me to know. While links to the Microsoft material is used and referenced here for this study guide, this is not an official Microsoft course {or anything approved by Microsoft really :sweat_smile: }

> **_Disclaimer:_** Always follow the official exam material from Microsoft. BUT I hope this study helps a little. Best of Luck ðŸ¤ž
