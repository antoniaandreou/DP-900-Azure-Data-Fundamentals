> # **_Module 3: Explore concepts of relational data_** 

- ### Characteristics of relational data
	- A data model made of collections of entities from the real world in the form of tables
	- **_Entity_** = _a thing which information needs to be known or held_
	- Tables are made of rows and columns
	- Rows represent a single instance of an entity, table can contain any number
	- Columns represent the properties of an entity, same across all rows
- ### What is a primary key (PK)
	- A unique identifier for each row in a table
	- Can be made of 1 or more columns
	- Can not be empty (NULL) 
	- Can not be repeated
- ### What is a foreign key (FK)
	- A value that links to a primary key of another table
	- Used to maintain relationships between tables
	- Enables the identification & prevention of anomalies
- ### Define **_normalization_**
	- Splitting an entity into more than one table 			
- ### What are the Structure Query Language (SQL) commands 
    - **CREATE TABLE** 
	- **INSERT** = to store data in a table
	- **UPDATE** = to modify data in a table
	- **DELETE** = to remove rows from a table
	- **SELECT** = to retrieve data from a table
- ### What are OLTP applications
    - _Online Transaction Processing_ focus on transaction-oriented tasks that process a very large number of transactions per minute
- ### Cases of where a relational database would be used for OLTP applications
    - Banking solutions
	- Online retail applications
	- Flight reservation systems
	- Many online purchasing applications
- ### Define Tables
    - Can have 0 or more rows
	- Fixed set of columns
	- Can use PK and FK to define relationships between them
	- Can use SQL to access data in the tables
	- Tables make up a relational database
- ### Define Views
    - A virtual table based on a query
	- Can query/filter a view just like a table
	- Can be used to join tables together
	- Suitable for regularly needed information
- ### Define Indexes
    - Helps data search in a table 
	- Indexes are per single column
	- Column data copied and sorted
	- Speeds up queries with a WHERE clause as eliminates the row-by-row look up
	- Can have multiple indexes per table
	- Disadvantages:
		- Consume additional space
		- Any change on its table, requires for the index to be updated
		- Slower table changes
		- Additional charges
	- Preferable for indexes to be created based on columns that are modified infrequently
- ### Define _Clustered_ Index
	- Physically re-organise the table based on its index column
	- Speeds up querying even further
	- Only 1 clustered index per table
- ### On-premise (+/-)
	## +
    - Ensures close control over the data
	- Reliable & secure
	- Lower operational expenditure
	## -
	- Higher capital expenditure
		- Purchase of database software
		- Maintain both hardware and software
	- End-to-end management
	- Scalability can be slow & costly
- ### Cloud computing (+/-)
	## +
	- Improves scalability
	- Improves agility
	- Time and cost savings
	- No capital expenses
	- Regular data backups
	- Instant provisioning
	- Data can be stored at different regions
	## -
	- No peronal control of data security
	- Higher operational expenditure
- ### Define IaaS
    - Infrastructure as a Service
	- Fully user managed cloud operation
	- Enable lift and shift between on-premise & cloud
	- Achieved via virtual machines and networks
		- Manual scaling of resources
	- User has full responsibility over the software (purchase, running, maintenance)
	- End-to-end database management without the capital expense of hardware
	- Best for operating system-level access
- ### Define PaaS
    - Platform as a Service
	- Hardware and software are managed by third party
	- Automatic & quick scaling of resources
	- Supports virtualized versions of all popular databases
	- Some functional restrictions of the database due to security
	- Operating system & hardware specifications might be unavailable
