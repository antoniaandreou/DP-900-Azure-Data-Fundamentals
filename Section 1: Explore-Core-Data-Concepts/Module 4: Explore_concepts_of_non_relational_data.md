> # **_Module 4: Explore concepts of non relational data_** 

- ### Characteristics of non-relational database
    - Enables the quick data capture
    - Useful for quick ingestion pipelines
    - Stores data in its original state and format
    - Flexible data storage
    - Non-schema database
    - Entities are self describing
    - Entities have a unique key-value
    - Best to search db on key-value or index (if supported)
    - Searching on another field can be extremely time consuming
        - Search every collention
        - Search each entity in the collection
        - Search every field in the entity
- ### Cases of where a non-relational database would be used
    - IoT _(Internet of Things)_ and telematics
        - large amounts of data ingestions in frequent bursts
    - Retail and marketing
        - storage of catalogue data
        - event sourcing, processing pipelines
    - Gaming
        - db needs to be super fast
        - able to handle massive spikes
    - Web and mobile applications
        - Azure Cosmo db commonly used and is well suited for:
            - modelling social interactions
            - integrating with 3rd party services
            - building rich personalized experiences
- ### Types of non-relational data
    - Semi-structured
    - Unstructured 
- ### Describe semi-structure data
    - Data that contains fields
    - Fields vary between entities
    - Fields are defined on a need-by per-entity basis
    - Entities can be stored as:
        - JSON document per entity
        - Avro
        - ORC
        - Parquet
- ### What is JSON
    - JavaScript Object Notation
    - Format used by JavaScript to store data in memory
    - Can be also used to read and write documents to/from files
    - Enclosed in curly brackets ({entity})
    - _field name: field value, another field: another value_
    - Field value can be
        - simple values
        - subdocuments _({another JSON file})_
        - multiple values held in _([arrays])_
        - fixed values _"held in quotes",_
- ### What is Avro
    - Data organized into rows
    - Each record has a header
    - Each header describes the data structure in the record 
    - Headers are stored in JSON
    - Data is stored in binary information
    - Very good for:
        - compressing data
        - minimizing storage
        - minimizing network bandwidth
- ### What is ORC
    - Optimized Row Columnar
    - Data organized into columns _(stripes of data)_
    - Each stripe holds data for 1 or more columns
    - For each column a stripe contains:
        - index into the rows
        - data for each row
        - statistical information footer
    - Optimized to read & write operations in Apache Hive
        - Hive:
            - data warehouse system
            - fast data summarization
            - fast data querying over very last datasets
- ### What is Parquet
    - Data organized into columns
    - Data for each column stored together in the same row group
    - Each row group contains 1 or more data chunks
    - Files include metadata
    - Metadata:
        - describes rows in each chunk
        - used to locate quickly the correct chunk of data for a given set of rows
        - used to retrieve column data for this set of rows
    - Efficient in storing & processing nested data types
    - Efficient in compression & encoding schemes
- ### Describe unstructured data
    - Doesn't naturally contain fields
    - Examples:
        - Audio files
        - Video files
        - Other media files
    - Amorphous blob of binary data
    - Unable to search specific elements 
    - Stored in block blobs _(blob = Binary Large Object)_ that support only basic read/write
- ### What is NoSQL
    - Means non-relational database
    - 4 NoSQL categories
        - key-value stores
        - document databases
        - column family databases
        - graph databases
- ### What is key-value store
    - Simplest & quickest No SQL db for inserting & querying data
    - Read and writes data very quickly
    - Ideal for continual stream data ingestion that needs to be stored immediately
    - Each data item has 2 elements:
        - A key -_uniquely identifies item_
        - A value -_holds value for item  as an unstructured block_
    - Items stored in key order 
    - Can not search on values
    - Queries are key based
    - Restricted to inserts and deletes  
    - Eg. Azure Table or Table API in Cosmos db 
- ### What is a document database
    - Each document has a unique ID = **_document key_**
    generated either:
        - automatically by the db
        - selecting a specific field
    - Document fields are transparent to the db management system
    - Document structures can vary **_+ great flexibility_**
    - Able to query & filter data by
        - using field values
        - indexes of 1 or more fields
    - Documents can be stored as:
        - plain text
        - JSON _(most popular)_
        - XML
        - YAML
        - BSON
    -Depending on the db system:
        - in-place updates of specific fields **_- db fragmentation & reduced performance_**
        - read & write entire document _(aka entire document replacement)_
    - Large data ingestion **but NOT** as optimal as key-store dbs
    - **Better** at querying data
    - Azure Cosmos db through its _Core (SQL) API_
